Something he did not elaborate further on.\n- If they do not enter into an agreement, there will be bombings.\n- It will be bombings like they have never seen before, said Trump in the telephone interview with NBC News.\nTrump has previously - in a letter to Iran - encouraged the regime in Tehran to enter into a new nuclear agreement with the US.\nIran will not negotiate under threats\nIran responded last week to Donald Trump\u2019s letter, stating that its policy is not to engage in direct negotiations with the US as long as Washington's maximum pressure campaign and military threats against the country continue.\nIn the NBC interview, Trump also threatened Iran with so-called secondary tariffs, which affect buyers of a country's goods. He signed a presidential decree last week authorizing such tariffs against buyers of Venezuelan oil.\n- We will probably give it a couple of weeks, and if we do not see any progress, we will introduce them. We are not introducing them right now, said Donald Trump late Danish time to a group of journalists aboard Air Force One.\nTehran claims that its nuclear program is exclusively for civilian energy purposes."

The country's Ministry of Education also encourages parents to support the ban by also ensuring healthy meals for their children.\nUNICEF has declared \u2018obesity epidemic\u2019 a state of emergency\nWhen the government not only recommends keeping sugar and fat out of schools, but introduces a concrete ban, it is in an attempt to combat childhood obesity.\nBecause that is a big problem in Mexico.\nIn a 2020 report, UNICEF wrote that the children in the country eat more junk food than anywhere else in Latin America. The organization classifies the nation's childhood obesity epidemic as a state of emergency.\nUnicef points out that being overweight in childhood affects children's development and can increase the risk of them becoming ill as adults.\nMore than a third of the country's children are, according to UNICEF and statistics from the organization World Obesity Federation, overweight.\nIf schools violate the ban on unhealthy food, they risk a fine of up to approximately 37,000 Danish kroner.\nBut in a country with 255,000 schools, many of which, for example, lack drinking fountains and stable electricity - it may be difficult to enforce the ban in the real world, notes the news bureau AP."

The two countries stand closely together in the question of European sovereignty,\" said a source at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.\n\nThe Danish royal couple is accompanied by, among others, Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen and Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen, and defense is a significant part of the three-day program.\n\nFrance is the world's second-largest arms exporter \u2013 surpassed only by the United States \u2013 and therefore, King Frederik will, among other things, visit the French defense company KNDS, which produces the Caesar cannons that Denmark has donated to Ukraine.\n\n**Also Important for Business**\n\nAlso from the Danish side, it is emphasized that Denmark's first state visit to France since 1978 has a particularly special relevance.\n\n\"France is incredibly important to Denmark and to Europe, both militarily, politically, culturally and commercially. And that is only more important to mark at the highest level with a state visit, when we are in a period of great geopolitical change and uncertainty,\" said Hanne Fugl Eskj\u00e6r, Denmark's ambassador to France.\n\nOver the weekend, communication lines have been buzzing between the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace and Amalienborg, between French and Danish embassies, ministries and security services to finalize the last details ahead of the grand visit.\n\nThe royal couple is accompanied by as many as four ministers and a large business delegation of around 50 Danish companies, which on the tour will focus particularly on European resilience within energy, health and, of course, defense.\n\n\"All Danes Welcome\"\n\nDespite the serious backdrop of the state visit, the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace also allows itself to be pleased with the personal relationship between the Danish royal couple and the French presidential couple.\n\nThe fact that Denmark's king is half-French and speaks the language fluently, makes the relationship so close that sources at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace describe the relationship between Denmark and France as \"familial.\"\n\nIf one examines the program for the coming three days, it is also clear that Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron will spend considerably more time with King Frederik and Queen Mary than ceremony and formality dictate.\n\nThe program allows for art, culture and festivities.\n\nThus, the royal couple will, among other things, visit Notre Dame Cathedral together with Monsieur and Madame Macron, while there is also time set aside for a boat trip on the Seine, a visit to a tapestry workshop, a gala dinner at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace on Monday evening and a return lunch with the Danish royal couple as hosts on Tuesday evening.\n\nA flock of Parisian pensioners, who welcome the Danish royal couple at the military complex Les Invalides, where long rows of Danish flags and Tricolors flutter along the esplanade, believe the festivities are well deserved:\n\n\"Parisians are looking forward to welcoming you! Welcome to our magnificent capital, which we love so much,\" said Laure Renouf, retired physiotherapist.\n\nThe retired bookseller Dominique enthusiastically supplements:\n\n\"I would like to welcome ALL Danes to Paris! As Europeans, we are happy to see the Danish flag here.\""

It seems like they want Syria to be strong and stable, he says in\nP1 Morgen\n.\nThe interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has formed a government where several minorities are represented. It includes a Christian, an Alawite and a Kurd.\nTarek Kelani is not surprised by the new government composition, as al-Sharaa, shortly after his rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) took power in Syria, promised to look after them.\n- Having people from minority backgrounds is fantastic, says Tarek Kelani.\n- I am glad to see that they have lived up to what has been said.\nGreater Security\nTarek Kelani still has family living in Syria, and he says that many of their conditions have improved in recent weeks.\nHe points, among other things, to the fact that prices on a wide range of goods have fallen, and that it has become easier to obtain food and gasoline. But also that it has become safer to be.\n- When I talk to my parents, they mention this feeling that they are not as afraid as they were before when they walk in the street, says Tarek Kelani.\nAfter the initial joy over Bashar al-Assad being overthrown, a certain form of skepticism towards the interim president also set in, says Tarek Kelani.\nAhmed al-Sharaa has a past in both al-Qaeda and the Islamic State. And his rebel group HTS, which helped to overthrow Assad, originates from al-Qaeda and is on the UN's list of terrorist groups.\nThere have also been several\nmurders of the religious minority Alawites\n, which have been committed by security forces from Syria\u2019s new power holders. Ahmed al-Sharaa has called this \"expected challenges,\" and a committee has been set up to investigate the crimes further.\nAnd although according to Tarek Kelani it is a much-discussed topic, he believes that the mood towards the interim president has improved after he has started to deliver on some of his promises.\n- Now my clear impression is that people are super happy with him, says Tarek Kelani.\nIf, however, there is one thing that worries Tarek Kelani, it is what will happen with the sanctions that the outside world has against Syria. He hopes that countries are willing to reach out to Syria and see the country as a possible partner.\nThe first steps have already been taken towards this. In February\nsuspended\nthe EU several sanctions against Syria, which were, among other things, against banks, oil, gas and electricity.\nThe EU\ncondemned\nthe violence and murders of the Alawites, but is simultaneously monitoring the development in the country with the aim of whether more sanctions should be lifted or reintroduced if the development goes the wrong way.\nListen to the entire interview with Tarek Kelani in\nP1 Morgen in DR Lyd here\n:"

According to the news agency Reuters, the amount is over three million euros.\nThe party has called the trial a witch hunt and denies that any mistakes were made.\nLe Pen has been among the last two candidates on the ballot in the latest two French presidential elections.
